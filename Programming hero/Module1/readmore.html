        <P>I love traveling, but I never go anywhere without my parents. In 2025, I got an opportunity to visit Bandarban and Cox’s Bazar on a departmental tour. I spent four days with my friends and teachers. I visited many places that gave me peace and made me realize how beautiful the world is.</P>
      <p>My experience in Bandarban was calm and refreshing. The green hills, fresh air, and peaceful environment gave me a sense of relaxation. Walking along the hilly roads, seeing waterfalls, and watching clouds cover the mountains were truly unforgettable moments. Being close to nature made me feel grateful and helped me realize how beautiful the world is.</p>
      <p>Spending time in Cox’s Bazar was full of joy and excitement. The vast sea, the sound of the waves, and walking on the sandy beach were very enjoyable. Watching the sunset over the ocean was a breathtaking experience. Spending time with my friends by the beach and enjoying the sea breeze made the trip even more special.</p>
